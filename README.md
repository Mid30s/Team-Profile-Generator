## Description
My team profile generator project is a command-line application that allows users to create a professional-looking team profile page based on the input they provide. The idea for this project came from my desire to create an easy-to-use tool for managers and team leaders to create and manage their team's profile page, which is a crucial aspect of team building and collaboration.

I built this project to solve the problem of manually creating and formatting team profile pages, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. With this application, users can easily input their team members' information, including their names, roles, IDs, email addresses, and other relevant details, and the program will generate a professional-looking HTML page that can be easily shared with team members or clients.

Through building this project, I learned about various programming concepts, including object-oriented programming, test-driven development, and modularization. I also gained experience working with popular Node.js packages such as Inquirer and Jest, which helped me to streamline the development process and ensure the reliability of the application.

What makes my project stand out is its simplicity and user-friendliness. The application is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear prompts and error messages to guide users through the process. Additionally, the generated HTML page is clean, well-organized, and customizable, allowing users to easily tailor it to their team's needs. Overall, I believe that my team profile generator project is a valuable tool for anyone looking to create a professional-looking team profile page quickly and easily.
